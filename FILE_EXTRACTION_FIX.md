# File Extraction Fix - Summary

## 🐛 Issue Identified

The agent's single tool `create_files_from_request` was working correctly and returning the proper JSON output:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "files": [
    {
      "filename": "TEST.md",
      "content": "This is a test.",
      "path": "TEST.md",
      "message": "Create TEST.md as requested"
    }
  ],
  "count": 1
}
```

However, the file extraction logic in `process_issue()` was not properly parsing the `ToolMessage` instances that contain the tool results. This caused the agent to:

1. ✅ Successfully call the tool
2. ✅ Get the correct JSON response
3. ❌ Fail to extract files from the response
4. ❌ Fall back to creating a generic metadata file instead

## 🔧 Root Cause

The original extraction logic was looking for:
1. JSON patterns in the final message content (regex-based)
2. Tool calls in message attributes

But it was missing the most important source: **`ToolMessage` instances** that contain the actual tool execution results.

## ✅ Fix Applied

Updated the file extraction logic in `process_issue()` to:

1. **First priority**: Look for `ToolMessage` instances with `name == "create_files_from_request"`
2. **Second priority**: Parse JSON from generated content (regex fallback)
3. **Third priority**: Look through tool calls and their results (complex fallback)

### Key Changes

```python
# Look for ToolMessage instances that contain the tool results
for msg in final_state.get("messages", []):
    # Check for ToolMessage instances (the actual tool results)
    if hasattr(msg, "name") and msg.name == "create_files_from_request":
        try:
            tool_result = json.loads(msg.content)
            if tool_result.get("success") and tool_result.get("files"):
                files_to_create.extend(tool_result["files"])
                log_info(f"Extracted {len(tool_result['files'])} files from ToolMessage")
                break  # Found the tool result, no need to continue
        except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
            log_error(f"Failed to parse ToolMessage JSON: {e}")
            continue
```

## 🧪 Verification

Created comprehensive tests to verify the fix:

### 1. Tool Functionality Test (`test_single_tool_final.py`)
- ✅ Tool accepts JSON array input correctly
- ✅ Tool returns proper JSON output format
- ✅ Tool handles errors gracefully
- ✅ System prompt contains correct instructions

### 2. File Extraction Logic Test (`test_extraction_logic.py`)
- ✅ Correctly extracts files from `ToolMessage` instances
- ✅ Handles edge cases (no ToolMessage, invalid JSON)
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with fallback methods

### 3. Integration Test (`test_integration.py`)
- ✅ End-to-end simulation of agent execution
- ✅ Proper file extraction from realistic message flow
- ✅ Correct file creation logic processing

## 📈 Expected Behavior Now

When processing a GitHub issue like "Create TEST.md with content 'This is a test.'":

1. **Agent analyzes** the issue
2. **Tool is called** with `[{"filename": "TEST.md", "file_content": "This is a test."}]`
3. **Tool returns** JSON with file specifications
4. **Agent extracts** files from the `ToolMessage` ✅ (Previously failed)
5. **Files are created** in the GitHub repository ✅
6. **Pull request** is created with the actual requested files ✅

## 🎯 Result

- ✅ **Single tool** architecture maintained
- ✅ **File extraction** now works correctly
- ✅ **Agent creates** the exact files requested in GitHub issues
- ✅ **No more fallback** to generic metadata files
- ✅ **Enhanced logging** with JSON pretty-printing
- ✅ **Comprehensive testing** ensures reliability

The agent should now successfully process GitHub issues and create the requested files in the target repository as intended.
