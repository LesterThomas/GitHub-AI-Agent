# GitHub AI Agent - Single Tool Refactor

## Overview

The GitHub AI Agent has been refactored to use a single, streamlined tool called `create_files_from_request`. This simplifies the agent's workflow and makes it more focused on the core task of creating files based on GitHub issue requests.

## Tool Description

### `create_files_from_request`

**Purpose**: Process file creation requests from GitHub issues and return a structured list of files ready for GitHub creation.

**Input**: JSON string containing an array of file objects. Each object must have:
- `filename`: The name of the file to create (required)
- `file_content`: The content for the file (optional, defaults to placeholder content)

**Output**: JSON object containing:
- `success`: Boolean indicating if the operation was successful
- `files`: Array of file objects ready for GitHub API
- `count`: Number of files processed
- `error`: Error message (if any)

### Example Usage

**Input Format**:
```json
[
  {
    "filename": "README.md",
    "file_content": "# Project Title\n\nThis is a sample README file."
  },
  {
    "filename": "config.json",
    "file_content": "{\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"name\": \"example\"\n}"
  }
]
```

**Output Format**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "files": [
    {
      "filename": "README.md",
      "content": "# Project Title\n\nThis is a sample README file.",
      "path": "README.md",
      "message": "Create README.md as requested"
    },
    {
      "filename": "config.json",
      "content": "{\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"name\": \"example\"\n}",
      "path": "config.json", 
      "message": "Create config.json as requested"
    }
  ],
  "count": 2
}
```

## Agent Workflow

1. **Issue Analysis**: The agent receives a GitHub issue and analyzes it to understand what files need to be created.

2. **Tool Invocation**: The agent calls `create_files_from_request` with a properly formatted JSON array containing the file specifications.

3. **File Processing**: The tool processes the input and returns a structured response with files ready for GitHub creation.

4. **Branch Creation**: The agent creates a feature branch in the target repository.

5. **File Creation**: Files are created in the repository using the GitHub API.

6. **Pull Request**: A pull request is created with the new files.

## System Prompt

The agent uses a focused system prompt that instructs it to:
- Analyze GitHub issues for file creation requests
- Use only the `create_files_from_request` tool
- Format input as JSON arrays with proper structure
- Be direct and focused in its approach

## Enhanced Logging

The agent includes enhanced logging with JSON pretty-printing for better readability:

- **Tool Usage**: Input and output JSON is pretty-printed with proper indentation
- **State Changes**: Agent state changes are logged with visual formatting
- **Error Handling**: Errors are clearly logged with color coding
- **JSON Formatting**: All JSON data in logs is automatically pretty-printed

## Key Features

### Simplified Architecture
- Single tool reduces complexity
- Clear input/output format
- Focused on core functionality

### Robust Error Handling
- Invalid JSON input is handled gracefully
- Missing required fields are detected
- Errors are returned in structured format

### Flexible Content Generation
- Supports any file type
- Handles complex content with proper escaping
- Allows empty content with sensible defaults

### Enhanced Observability
- Comprehensive logging with color coding
- JSON pretty-printing for readability
- Step-by-step execution tracking

## Usage Examples

### Simple File Creation
For an issue: "Create a file called test.md with content 'Hello World'"

The agent will call:
```json
[{"filename": "test.md", "file_content": "Hello World"}]
```

### Multiple Files
For an issue: "Create README.md and package.json for a new project"

The agent will call:
```json
[
  {
    "filename": "README.md", 
    "file_content": "# New Project\n\nProject description here."
  },
  {
    "filename": "package.json",
    "file_content": "{\n  \"name\": \"new-project\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\"\n}"
  }
]
```

## Testing

The agent includes comprehensive testing that verifies:
- Tool functionality with valid input
- Error handling with invalid input
- System prompt configuration
- Output format compliance

Run tests with:
```bash
python test_single_tool_final.py
```

## Configuration

The agent maintains the same configuration options:
- `model`: OpenAI model to use (default: "gpt-4")
- `max_iterations`: Maximum agent iterations
- `recursion_limit`: LangGraph recursion limit
- Target repository settings

## Benefits of Single Tool Approach

1. **Simplicity**: Easier to understand and maintain
2. **Reliability**: Single point of functionality reduces failure modes
3. **Consistency**: Uniform input/output format
4. **Debugging**: Clearer execution path and logging
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to enhance the single tool without affecting workflow

## Migration Notes

- Previous multi-tool approach has been replaced
- All file creation logic is now centralized in one tool
- System prompt updated to reflect new workflow
- Enhanced logging provides better visibility into agent operations
- Backward compatibility maintained for GitHub API integration
