# Enhanced Logging Features

The GitHub AI Agent now includes comprehensive color-coded console logging to track all interactions between the agent, LLM, and tools as it processes issues and creates files in the SAAA repository.

## SAAA Repository Workflow

The agent operates on the SAAA repository with the following workflow:
1. **Fetch Issues**: Monitor issues in the source repository (where the agent runs)
2. **Create Feature Branch**: Create a new feature branch in the SAAA repository
3. **Generate Files**: Create or update files in the SAAA repository on the feature branch
4. **Create Pull Request**: Submit a PR to merge changes into the SAAA repository's main branch
5. **Add Comment**: Comment on the original issue with the PR link

## Color Scheme

- **ðŸ”µ Agent Actions (Blue)**: All agent-initiated actions and state changes
- **ðŸŸ¢ LLM Interactions (Green)**: Requests to and responses from the language model
- **ðŸŸ£ Tool Usage (Magenta)**: Tool invocations with inputs and outputs
- **ðŸ”´ Errors (Red)**: Error messages and exceptions
- **ðŸŸ¡ Warnings (Yellow)**: Warning messages
- **ðŸŸ¦ Info (Cyan)**: General information and status updates

## Log Types

### Agent Actions
- `INIT`: Initialization steps
- `START`/`COMPLETE`: Process start and completion
- `FETCH`: Data retrieval operations  
- `BRANCH_CREATE`: Git branch creation
- `FILE_CREATE`/`FILE_COMMIT`: File operations
- `PR_CREATE`: Pull request creation
- `SUCCESS`/`FAILED`: Final status

### LLM Interactions
- `REQUEST`: Messages sent to the LLM
- `RESPONSE`: Responses received from the LLM

### Tool Usage
- Shows tool name, inputs, and outputs for all tool invocations
- Includes tools like `analyze_issue_requirements`, `create_file_content`, `validate_content`

## Testing the Logging

Run the demo script to see all logging types in action:

```bash
python test_logging.py
```

This will demonstrate all the different logging categories with color coding without processing real GitHub issues.

## Console Output Example

```

## Implementation Details

The logging system includes:

1. **Color Support**: ANSI color codes for terminal output
2. **Timestamp Integration**: All log entries include timestamps
3. **Message Truncation**: Long messages are truncated for console readability
4. **Tool Tracking**: Detailed input/output logging for all tool calls
5. **LLM Monitoring**: Complete request/response cycle logging
6. **Error Handling**: Enhanced error logging with stack traces

The logging integrates seamlessly with Python's standard logging framework while adding visual enhancements for easier debugging and monitoring.
