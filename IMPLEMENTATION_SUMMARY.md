# Summary of SAAA Repository Reset Implementation

## âœ… Implementation Complete

I have successfully implemented the GitHub issue and pull request reset functionality as requested in issue #5.

## ðŸ”§ What Was Built

### 1. Extended GitHubClient Class
Added 4 new methods to `github_ai_agent/github_client.py`:
- `close_issue()` - Closes an issue by number
- `get_pull_requests()` - Retrieves pull requests with specified state
- `close_pull_request()` - Closes a pull request by number  
- `create_issue()` - Creates a new issue with title, body, and labels

### 2. Reset Script (`reset_saaa_repo.py`)
Main script that performs exactly what was requested:
- âœ… Retrieves all open issues in `https://github.com/LesterThomas/SAAA` and closes them
- âœ… Retrieves all open pull requests in `https://github.com/LesterThomas/SAAA` and closes them
- âœ… Creates 1 new issue with:
  - **Title**: "Create TEST.md"
  - **Description**: "Create a TEST.md markdown file and in the content of the file make up a poem about clouds."
  - **Labels**: "AI Agent"

### 3. Comprehensive Testing
- Unit tests for all new GitHubClient methods
- Dry-run testing to validate logic without API calls
- All tests pass successfully

### 4. Safety Features
- Distinguishes between real issues and pull requests (important since PRs appear as issues in GitHub API)
- Comprehensive error handling
- Clear progress logging
- Help documentation

## ðŸš€ Ready to Use

### To run the reset script:

1. **Set GitHub token**:
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
   ```

2. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python reset_saaa_repo.py
   ```

3. **For help**:
   ```bash
   python reset_saaa_repo.py --help
   ```

### Requirements:
- GitHub token with read/write permissions for issues and pull requests on `LesterThomas/SAAA`

## ðŸ”„ Integration with AI Agent

Once the script creates the new issue with the "AI Agent" label, the existing GitHub AI Agent will automatically detect it and process it according to the SAAA workflow, creating the requested TEST.md file with a poem about clouds.

## âœ¨ Key Benefits

1. **Minimal Changes**: Only added necessary methods without modifying existing functionality
2. **Comprehensive**: Handles all requirements in the issue description
3. **Safe**: Includes proper error handling and validation
4. **Well-Tested**: Complete test coverage for new functionality
5. **Well-Documented**: Clear documentation and help system

The implementation is ready for use and successfully addresses all requirements in issue #5!
